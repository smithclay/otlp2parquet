# otlp2parquet

`otlp2parquet` ingests OpenTelemetry (OTLP) data and stores it as compressed Parquet files in object storage. It uses a ClickHouse-compatible schema and runs in various environments, including Docker, Cloudflare Workers, and AWS Lambda.

This approach provides a fast, efficient, and cost-effective way to store and query your OpenTelemetry data.
